# Cornell Basic Needs Public Repository

## Nerd stuff

This website was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The backend for the guides uses [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), which allows live editing of pages. 
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) were used to style the pages. Icons were from [Lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev/)
